Instructions
Making Vegetable Balls

Take the finely chopped or grated veggies in a bowl. 
Then add the dry ingredients – corn starch, all-purpose flour (maida), black pepper and salt.
Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices. 
Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.
Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.
Make all veggie balls this way and keep aside.
Frying Veggie Balls

Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veg manchurian balls. If the balls break, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all purpose flour (maida).
Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much of oil.
When cooked from one side, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.
Fry the balls till crisp and golden.
Remove them with a slotted or perforated spoon and drain as much as oil as possible.
Place the fried veg manchurian balls on kitchen paper towels. For a low fat version, you can cook the veggie balls in an appe-appam pan or æbleskiver pan.
Fry the veg manchurian balls this way in batches and keep aside.
Making Sauce Or Gravy
In a small bowl take the following three sauces – soy sauce, tomato ketchup and red chilli sauce.
Mix the sauces very well and keep aside.
In another small bowl take 1 tablespoon cornflour and 2 tablespoons water. Mix very well and keep aside.
Heat 1 to 1.5 tablespoons oil in a pan or wok. Add the chopped spring onions, finely chopped ginger, finely chopped garlic, finely chopped green chilies and finely chopped capsicum. Adding capsicum is optional.
Stir fry on medium flame till the onions turn translucent.
Now add the mixed sauces. Stir and mix very well.
Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. Let the mixture come to a boil.
Mix the cornflour paste again in the bowl (as the cornflour settles at the bottom) and then add in the pan.
As soon as you add cornflour paste, mix very well so that there are no lumps.
Continue to stir and mix when the veg manchurian gravy is cooking. Simmer till the sauce thickens and you see a glaze in it. There should be no raw taste of the cornflour in the sauce. Cooking sauce or gravy takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium flame. If the sauce is too thick, then you add some water. If it is too thin, then you can add some cornflour.
When the veg manchurian sauce thickens, add ½ teaspoon black pepper powder.
Season with a bit of salt. Do keep in mind that the soy sauce, chilli sauce and tomato ketchup already has salt in it. So add less salt and as per your taste preferences.
Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar. Mix very well.
Then add the fried veg manchurian balls. Also add 1 teaspoon of Rice vinegar or regular vinegar or apple cider vinegar. 
Gently stir and coat the veg manchurian balls in the gravy.
Switch off the flame add chopped spring onion greens.
Serve veg manchurian hot garnished with some spring onion greens. This manchurian gravy goes well with veg fried rice, plain rice and even bread or the chapati or rotis.

Notes

Consistency: The best part of most Indian-Chinese recipes is you can change the consistency as per your liking. If you want a thin consistency, add some veg broth or water. If you want a thick consistency, add a few teaspoons of cornflour paste. This dish thickens after it cools down. So when reheating you may have to add some water.
Ajinomoto (MSG): I have not added any msg to the recipe. If you want a more restaurant style effect, you can do so. But a word of caution – msg or mono sodium glutamate is not good for the health.
Frying: Remember to fry the veg manchurian balls on medium heat. If they are fried on a high heat, then the outside will get cooked and the inside will be not cooked leaving a doughy taste in the mouth. If they are fried on a low heat, they will absorb oil and this will make them oily and soggy.
Sugar: I like the sweet sour taste of Indo Chinese food and hence I have added raw sugar to the recipe. You can use any other sweetener like palm sugar or coconut sugar instead of sugar. 

Soy Sauce: Use naturally fermented soy sauce. The soy sauce I use does not have any sugar added to it. You may avoid this or check the ingredients list in your soy sauce if sugar is there in it or not.

About Dry Vegetable Manchurian
Veg Manchurian Dry is a crispy starter snack of fried veg balls tossed in the spicy, sweet, tangy manchurian sauce.

It is one of the dishes that we order when we have dinner in an Indian-Chinese restaurant. It is one of my favorite dish from childhood. I have been making veg manchurian from from my teens. I make both gravy and the dry versions.

On occasions I make this dry manchurian version as a side dish with veg noodles.

veg manchurian dry recipe, dry vegetable manchurian dry recipe
The only time taking part in making dry vegetable manchurian is the grating or chopping the veggies. So the recipe does take time to prepare with frying the vegetable balls and then preparing the sauce.

For less work you can make the veg balls a day before and use them the next day. You can even use a food processor of a food chopper to ease your work.

Serve Veg Manchurian Dry as a starter snack or as a side dish with Hakka Noodles or Veg Chow Mein.

Once the balls are fried, then it is time to make the sauce. In another pan, heat about ½ tbsp of the same oil in which we fried the balls or ½ tbsp of sesame oil.

Notes
I have not added sugar in the sauce as the tomato ketchup and red chilli sauce already has sugar. If you want you can add a bit of sugar.

Hello Ma’am,

We are a big fan of your delicious and easy to follow recipes. Five stars all the way. Thanks a lot and keep up the good work. Just a quick feedback comment, when we update the number of serves then the quantity of ingredients is getting updated in the ingredients list but they are not getting updated in the “How to make…” steps. Would really appreciate if these could be auto updated according to the number of serves.5 stars
